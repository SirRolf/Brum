Brum
===================================
Brum is a small project I work on in my freetime. I want to make a robot that acts like a companion. Almost like having a mechanical pet.


## Features

* A distance sensor, can detect objects and will react if he meats something.
* The state machine can add new states with just one line.
* Motor controls.
