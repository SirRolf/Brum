Brum
===================================
Brum is a small project I work on in my free time. I want to make a robot that acts like a companion. Almost like having a mechanical pet.


## Implemented features

* A distance sensor, can detect objects and will react if he meets something.
* The state machine can add new states with just one line.
* Motor controls.

## Planned features

* A screen that can display text so Brum can talk.
* Function that can map the surroundings.
* Mood that can change.

## Planned hardware improvements

* Chassis.
* Holder for the battery.
* A way so we only need one Battery(now you need a battery for the motor's and the pi).
